            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the <hi>Reverend,</hi> our much honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Brethren,</hi> the Miniſters of the Goſpell within the County of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and City and County of <hi>Norwich,</hi> whether agreeing with us, or diſſenting from us in their perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, concerning <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is an excellent Rule, preſcribed by the great Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (in caſe of Brethrens diſſentings each from other,) that <hi>wherein they have attained, they ſhould yet walke by the ſame Rule, minding the ſame thing.</hi> By vertue of which we preſume, to offer our Brethren our <hi>Agreement</hi> in the matter of <hi>Catechizing,</hi> being the <hi>firſt fruits</hi> of our long debates, and what we perſwade our ſelves, will meet with a deſirable acceptance from them. We cannot in the leaſt doubt <hi>(Dear and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Brethren,)</hi> but that many of you (however of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering perſwaſions from us in ſome things of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Order, or in regard of your remoteneſs of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, not Aſſociated with us,) have with an equall moving of Bowels with (if not exceeding any of) us, conſidered the ſad effects, which the want of a <hi>ſetled Diſcipline</hi> in the Church; the <hi>diviſions</hi> of Brethren in their Sentiments, concerning the things of Religion, and (we are afraid) our own too great deficiency to our
<pb facs="tcp:62331:3"/>reſpective Duties, have produced in ſeverall parts of theſe as well as other Counties in this Nation. If both we, and our fellow Servants had not too long ſlept, the enemy (doubtleſs) had not <hi>ſown Tares,</hi> to ſuch an unhappy advantage. The conſideration of which, did at laſt <hi>Alarum</hi> ſome of us (more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſcituated for a correſpondence each with other;) to a ſerious conſideration of what (in this diſſetled eſtate of the Church of God amongſt us) might <hi>by a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Aſſociation, and mutuall Obligation</hi> laid upon each other, be done to give a little check to that torrent of confuſion, which we ſaw every day like a ſtreame of <hi>mighty waters</hi> ruſhing in upon us, and upon the people for whom we muſt be accountable in the day of Jeſus Chriſt. Having therefore firſt agreed in ſome Rules of Order to be obſerved by us, for the managing of more generall, and particular meetings, for the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to ſo noble an end, as is the preſerving amongſt us the <hi>unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace;</hi> the firſt thing we propounded for the Subject of our debates, was an <hi>uniforme agreement in the Adminiſtration of all the Ordinances of the Goſpell,</hi> of which the Lord had made us <hi>Stewards:</hi> that having by a joynt owning of the Doctrine contained in the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> and <hi>Catechiſmes,</hi> adviſed by the <hi>Late Reverend Aſſembly,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared our oneneſs of judgment in the things of God, We might likewiſe agree in the ſame practice, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as to publick Adminiſtrations, <hi>ſerving the Lord with one heart, in one and the ſame way;</hi> and by this meanes taking away all ſtumbling blocks out of the way of weak Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Upon a ſurvey of publick Ordinances, we found that ſome (which we muſt look upon as publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,) had been for a long time diſuſed, and that ſome
<pb facs="tcp:62331:3"/>began to queſtion, whither there were any divine war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for them: theſe were <hi>publick Catechizing, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures, and ſinging of Pſalmes in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Congregations.</hi> We reſolved to begin with the firſt, in our debates. And becauſe it is queſtioned by ſome, whether there be any warrant for it in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or any great need or profitable uſe of it; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers queſtion, whether any but Children be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it? and others are again divided in their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, concerning the particular <hi>forme</hi> of Catechiſme, moſt fit to be univerſally uſed: And laſtly, (while the Magiſtrate pleaſeth to interpoſe his authority,) We perceived ſome at a loſs to determine, what could be done by us as Miniſters, to promove it, amongſt fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward people, who ſhould not be found willing to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to this Method of inſtruction. We of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered all theſe things firſt to the more private debates of our Brethren in their <hi>particular Aſſociations,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt agreed amongſt themſelves, were deſired to ſend in their thoughts to the <hi>generall meeting;</hi> which reſults of their more private debates, when we had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from them, and came to compare them each with other, we found no difference in judgment amongſt us concerning the things, and very inconſiderable differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in the Sentiments of particular Brethren, relating to the uniforme practice and exerciſe of them. What ſmall diverſities there were in the ſeverall Papers, were eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reconciled, upon a debate in a <hi>generall Meeting.</hi> And conſidering with our ſelves, what a prejudice the world (this part of the world eſpecially) hath entertained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this uſefull exerciſe, becauſe it is repreſented to them as a <hi>puerile</hi> exerciſe; and by reaſon of the <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall</hi> which others have brought upon it, as tending but to a <hi>forme of knowledg,</hi> or at moſt but to a <hi>forme of
<pb facs="tcp:62331:4"/>godlineſs,</hi> and (in their opinions) anticipating the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſpirit, (which many cant of in theſe daies, but wofully betray themſelves, that they know not of what they ſpeak, the ſpirit teaching men not by Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſianiſmes, but by and in the uſe of meanes, and much, <hi>(Secundum quod n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

We ſay conſidering theſe things, that we might (together with our Brethren in other parts of the Nation,) beare a publick Teſtimony, to the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of this ancient exerciſe, and let our people know, upon what grounds we have ſo deliberately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the Agreement we are come to (through Gods bleſſing) upon our debates, as to the reviving the prctaice of this exerciſe amongſt us; As alſo how far they ſtand obliged to a ſubmiſſion to it: We thought ſit to refer it to one of our Brethren, out of our ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Papers to draw up, the Summe of our Agreement in this thing, with ſome <hi>explanatory Diſcourſes,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Arguments which prevailed with us, to enforce ſuch an Agreement from us; and an Exhortation to the ſeverall perſons, who are Members of our <hi>particular Congregations,</hi> to a juſt ſubmiſſion and performance of their duty, both in reference to us their Miniſters, and more eſpecially to their own ſouls, and the ſouls of thoſe who are committed to their domeſticall charge. Which being done, and the draught (as is here preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you, appproved by us) we thought fit to publiſh it to the world, as a teſtimony of our unanimity in this thing, and concurrence with our Brethren in other parts, and as a witneſs, both againſt our ſelves, and our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb facs="tcp:62331:4"/>too, if our people ſhall hereafter periſh, <hi>through want of</hi> ſuch <hi>knowledg,</hi> as may this way (through the bleſſing of God upon our endeavours) be communicated unto them. We hope our <hi>Reverend Brethren</hi> will not conceive every perſon in our Aſſociation, reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall for every particular paſſage in the <hi>Explanatory Diſcourſes,</hi> or <hi>Exhortation</hi> annexed, much leſs for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry failer the Preſs may be guilty of; but only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that we are joyntly agreed in the <hi>Articles,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring our <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>reſolutions</hi> to practice in this thing, and to the ſubſtance of what is contained in the diſcourſes annexed, explaining the grounds of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, and the matter of the Exhortation, though we have not particularly examined every <hi>Quotation,</hi> or <hi>accent;</hi> or (if we had thought it conſiderable) poſſibly this or that <hi>phraſe</hi> might have been altered by ſome one or other of us. The ſumme of what we here preſent is the Agreement of foure ſcore and odde Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Aſſociation with us, and that upon due and mature deliberation. And nothing herein, having been impoſed by us upon his Brother, by the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall dictate</hi> of any one, but being firſt propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and debated, freely conſented to by all preſent and concerned in it, as overruled by the dictates of their own conſciences, and force of <hi>Argument,</hi> we conceive it both will &amp; ought to make the deeper impreſſion upon others; and will be conceived by all, who have concurred in it, more highly obliging to a ſuitable practice, of what in theſe debates they have either pleaded for, or at leaſt by a ſilent vote conſented to, refuſing the liberty grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them throughout the debates, to produce their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, either againſt the whole, or any part thereof.</p>
            <p>And we truſt that we need not multiply words to our other <hi>(Deare and Reverend Brethren)</hi> in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, who have not been equally concerned with us,
<pb facs="tcp:62331:5"/>in theſe debates, and this Agreement which comes forth as the reſult of them; conſidering that we know they are ſufficiently inſtructed, how much they are concerned,<note place="margin">Non eſt quod bonus dicat Paſtor, quid mihi cum ſordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do coriario, aut cum abjecto mendico, aut tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obolari malier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culâ?

For any of our Brethren to whom this may be any rock of offence that they have not been preſent with us; we ſhall only ſpeak unto them with alluſion to the words by which <hi>Gideon</hi> once pacified the <hi>Ephraimites,</hi> contending with him becauſe they were not called to fight with the <hi>Midianites. What have we done,</hi> in compariſon of what you yet may do? If God ſhall put into your hearts to practice with us what we have agreed. <hi>The gleaning of your Grapes of that nature, will be better then the Vintage of our debates,</hi> in reference to the end which we have purſued in all that we have done of this nature.</p>
            <p>The generality of our Brethren being (as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) ſufficiently with us convinced of their duty in the reviving of this ancient and uſefull exerciſe. We have nothing to do but only to ſtir up <hi>their pure minds by way of remembrance.</hi> That as they believe ſo they would alſo ſpeak and do. If any of our Brethren ſhall think we have extended the obligation too far, in
<pb facs="tcp:62331:6"/>bringing aged perſons under a duty of ſubmiſſion to to this method of inſtruction, and declaring our reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to deny the <hi>Sacrament of the Lords Supper,</hi> to ſuch as refuſe ſuch a ſubmiſſion; we ſhall (beſides what we have hereafter produced in our juſtification) mind our <hi>Reverend Bretheren,</hi> That we are inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a <hi>Reverend Brother,</hi> who upon diligent ſearch had found it in the Records of the Biſhops Courts, in the City of <hi>Norwich;</hi> That Miniſters were anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently enjoyned to go from ſeat to ſeat <hi>and to require of their ſeverall Pariſhoners, as well old as young, an account of their knowledg in the Principles of Religion, and both Miniſter and People were preſentable in the Eccleſiaſticall Courts, if either the one neglected his duty in inquiring ſuch account, or they omitted their duty in giving it to them.</hi> It hath been the conſtant judgement of all reformed Churches, that ignorant perſons ought not to be admitted to the Lords Supper. Thoſe <hi>Reverend</hi> Perſons, who by command of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and afterward of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, drew up that Book called <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatio Legum Eccleſiasticarum,</hi> determine that none ought to be admitted to the Lords Supper, <hi>whoſe Faith was not perfect in all parts.</hi>

What reaſons have conſtrained from us an Agreement as to the uſe of that forme, Our Brethren will ſee in the following ſheets; and we hope they will appeare as cogent to them, as they have been to us. The great Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. hath taught us how conducible to the avoiding of diviſions amongſt us, it is, that people <hi>ſpeake all the ſame thing,</hi> in matters of this nature, and our Brethren will eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, with us, how much it will gratifie, ſuch as are of weaker judgements and apprehenſions, to ſay nothing of the <hi>expediency</hi> of it, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the <hi>removals of Families,</hi> out of the precincts of one Congregation, into the Precincts of others.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62331:11"/>is evident from all ancient Writers: thus the Tranſlator of <hi>Clem. Alex.</hi> ordinarily interprets it.</p>
               <p>But the word taken in a more ſtrict and proper ſenſe,<note place="margin">Ea inſtitutio quae eſt ex au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditione.</note> hath been uſed to denote a more peculiar kind of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reſtrained both as to the <hi>matter</hi> taught, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of teaching.

This made Dr. <hi>Donn</hi> ſo earneſtly preſs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving of this exerciſe,<note place="margin">In a Sermon Preached at <hi>Pauls</hi> Croſs, <hi>Sep.</hi> 15. 1622. on <hi>Jud.</hi> 20.15.</note> and the <hi>Provinciall Aſſembly</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> commend it as the proper Antidote againſt the errors of theſe times. The neglect of it (ſaith Bp. <hi>Hall</hi>) breeds inſtability of judgment, <hi>miſtakes of neceſſary truths, faſhionableneſs of profeſſion, frothineſs of diſcourſe, obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to all error, and ſeduction.</hi> The ſoul that hath a ſmattering of ſome knowledg without orderly Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, is like a tree without roots, ſoon overturned, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in a wind. And it is no wonder, if there have been and ſtill are many ſuch like reeds overborne with every guſt of wind; and whoſe ſouls are at the beck of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very new upſtart Fable or fancy: the walls muſt needs be tottering, where the foundation is not laid deep e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. How can they chuſe but be carried away with every <hi>wind of Doctrine,</hi> who want the balaſt of ſound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in ſolid and conſiſtent Principles? Had there been more Catechizing, it is probable there would have been leſs Apoſtatizing in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor is this exerciſe of Catechizing leſs uſefull <hi>for the propagation,</hi> then for the preſervation of true Religion. We mentioned before the opinion of <hi>Hegeſippus,</hi> that by this meanes Chriſtian Religion ſo early overſpread the world. Sr. <hi>Edwin Sands</hi> takes notice of it, as a great meanes, whereby the Proteſtant Party enlarged its bounds. And the Prefatory Epiſtle to the <hi>Romane Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm,</hi> confeſſeth the ſame, ſadly complaining, that the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62331:15"/>Popiſh cauſe ſuffered moſt by thoſe Writings of ours, which we call Catechiſmes.<note place="margin">Haec ſi unquam aliàs ſentit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra aetas, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta damna hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticorum filii: non modo tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reâ ſuâ linguâ, verum multo maximè peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentibus ſcriptis, quae Catechiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inorum titulas ornare ſolent, Eccleſiae Chriſti inſerant, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſat. ad Catech.

And how can we expect either the inlargement or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the reformed Religion, but by the ſame experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced waies and meanes whereby it was at firſt revived? Nor is there only a future good, forelaid for poſterity, but a preſent advantage alſo accrewing unto particular Chriſtians, who are hereby rendred more fit for <hi>Hearing, Reading, Prayer, diſcerning the Lords Body in his Supper,</hi> &amp;c. We cannot but look upon this, as one reaſon of our Preaching ſo long to People, with ſo little profit, that (through the omiſſion, or former ſlighty performance of this duty, we do but build up Walls without a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and graff without a ſtock of Principles. <hi>Imitating</hi> (ſaith Bp. <hi>Hall</hi>) <hi>an indiſcreet Schoolmaſter, who too much affecting the thanks of an overweening Parent, marres the Child by raiſing him to an higher forme, before he hath learned his firſt Rules, from whence follows nothing but an empty oſtentation, and late diſappointment.</hi> Yea ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary did he (and not he alone) judge this wholeſome ſpoon-meat (which many now adaies think themſelves either too old, or too good, to be ſed with) that he could even quarrell with his Sermons, and wiſh that a great part of them had been exchanged for this Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conference. For the uſefullneſs of it we need ſay no more, conſidering how much hath been already ſaid by others. By the reviving of this exerciſe, we ſhall in ſome meaſure know the ſtate of our flock. Our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall be taught to know the Lord: The heavy eares of our people will be made to hear: the knowledge of the Goſpell will be propagated: Our people armed againſt falſe Teachers: and alſo againſt many dangerous temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, founded in the ignorance of Fundamentall Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; Chriſtians will be taught to reduce what they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62331:16"/>read and hear, to their proper heads: and a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be fairly laid in the underſtanding, for a naturall conſcience to conſcience to build Application upon, and to reſtraine much ſin by; and as it were a Wall builded in the ſoul, from which the holy ſpirit in his good time, may reflect ſaving beames, for the healing the will and affections. The uſefullneſs of it was ſuffiently experimented by our Forefathers. <hi>Euſebius</hi> gives a Catalogue of ſeaven or eight, who commenced Martyrs out of <hi>Origen's</hi> Catechiſticall Schoole at <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much having been ſaid of the uſeſullneſs of it at all times,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> the particular expediency of it in our times is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evinced. to ſay that we have the ignorant alwaies with us, and ſhall have ſo long, as it is the lot of the beſt, to know but in part, were enough; but the ſlighty perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this duty in former times, and the long omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it in later times, hath cauſed a greater degree of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance amongſt our people, than either ſuiteth our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, or the meanes of knowledg indulged to this laſt age. And the haſty and plentifull growth of the tares of error and moſt abſurd opinions, is a too ſad evidence to the world, that we have too long ſlept, as to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this piece of our duty, and that it is more then time the practice of it ſhould be revived amongſt us. To ſay nothing of the expediencie of it in reference to the proſecution of the intended reformation, ſo far as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the admiſſion of Communicants to the Table of the Lord; which is much hindred through the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſinfull modeſty of a people not tutored, in this Method of inſtruction. All theſe things evince it highly expedient in theſe thimes, where many ſleep under Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons without knowledg, and the little knowledg of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is overgrown with the weeds of error.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Concerning the Perſons, upon whom the duty of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion to this exerciſe, is incumbent.</head>
               <p>IT appearing from what hath been ſaid in the former Chapter, That Catechizing is an accommodate way of inſtructing Perſons in the Principles of Religion, we ſuppoſe it will eaſily be evinced, that the ignorant are the perſons thus to be inſtructed: theſe are eaſily diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into two ſorts; 1. <hi>Such as are Children in yeares.</hi> 2. <hi>Such as are Children in underſtanding.</hi> Though the latter have Mens háires, yet they have but Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Children ought to be Catechized will be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all, not willfully blind, or malitiouſly ſtubborne: the fitneſs of their years to receive inſtruction, and their ingagement upon Baptiſm to liſten to it, are arguments ſtrong enough to this cauſe.</p>
               <p>Childhood and youth is the time, wherein <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſeth the Children of men ſhould be trained up <hi>in the way wherein they ſhould go.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 22.6.</note> The lamentable experience that we have of the frowardneſs, and perverſeneſs of age, Men and Women who overſlipped their golden time of youth, chuſing rather to hazard the eternall ruine of their ſouls by covering their ignorance, than to ſubmit to a gentle cure thereof, is a ſufficient evidence that the twigg had need be bended, while it is young. Nor is that the fitteſt time only to receive Principles, but alſo to retaine inſtruction. Old trees tranſplanted ſeldome thrive, nor do Walls builded in Winter uſually ſtand. A new cloath (on the other ſide) hardly looſeth its firſt dye, nor the veſſell the ſavour of that liquor with which it was firſt ſeaſoned. <hi>Timothy</hi> was trained up in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, from his infancy, and departed not from them in his age.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:62331:17"/>
               <p n="2">2. We conceive all Religious Parents, will be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that by their engagement for their Children in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, they ſtand bound to God on their behalf, to bring them up <hi>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exo. 13.8, 14.</note> The Jews were to inſtruct their (hildren in the reaſon of the Paſſover. And there is no doubt, but <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> minded <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Sonne of the <hi>Covenent made in his ſleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But we are ſenſible, That our greateſt oppoſition to this practice, will be from ſuch as in years are no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but more than Children in underſtanding. Theſe, through a ſinfull loathneſs to diſcover their own igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and pretended modeſty, will and do plead hard for an exemption from this uſefull way of inſtruction. For our parts, as we are ſatisfied concerning their and our own duty, So reſolving (through the grace of God) not to be defective on our part, we ſhall, as becomes thoſe (who have the overſight of ſouls) require of them a performance of theirs, of which we verily believe they are ſufficiently convinced in their own conſciences; but that (without a faile of our duty to God) we may gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them as much, as may be, we ſhall (as we have ſaid) be content to deale with them in a more private way, having it not in our deſigne to diſcover their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, but as much as in us lieth, to hide them. To this purpoſe we have reſolved,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To allow ſome time on the week daies, in which they may come to us, or we to them, that we may diſcharge our duty in inſtructing them, and taking account of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We ſhall be alſo content to gratifie them in point of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy, as to company, and conferre with each one apart</hi> (only here we except <hi>all young Women</hi> for we are ſenſible how many ſcandals have beenraiſed, and may be raiſed of us by ſuch private examinations: <hi>but yet we ſhall allow ſitch Women, what company themſelves ſhall deſire to have with them.</hi>)</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If any through too much pride, ſhall think himſelf above
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62331:17"/>Catechizing by way of Queſtion and Anſwer, we ſhall be willing</hi> to deale with them by <hi>friendly conference.</hi> All that we aime at, is a cogniſance of their knowledg in the Principles of Religion, and by what lawfull meanes we attaine it, we are not ſolicitous, ſo they have it and we for the diſcharge of our conſciences be ſatisfied that they periſh not for want of knowledg.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To take away all prejudice from our people. We have thought fit alſo further to declare, <hi>That we are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the diſtance which God hath ſet between Parents and Children, Maſters and Servants:</hi> and far be it from us to do any thing which may render Superiours contemptible to ſuch as are under them; we ſhall therefore carefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void, any ſuch kind of Catechizing or conferring with perſons that have a preheminency in reſpect of years, and place, before ſuch as are young, or in any degree of ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or inferiority to them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>We are alſo ſenſible of differences betwixt the naturall parts of ſeverall perſons; and which have ariſen or may ariſe, through a disproportion of education.</hi> We have therefore declared, That we will carefully avoid all rigour and harſhneſs, and in the performance of this duty conforme our ſelves according to that meaſure of prudence which God hath given us, to the ſeverall parts and capacities of thoſe with whom we deale, ſo as to give all due encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the weakeſt, and not the leaſt diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any; our deſign being to inſtruct and edify, not to confound or diſcredit them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>But yet we have thought ſit to limit the age of ſuch to whom we ſhall at preſent indulge the liberty of a private conference, or addreſſes to us for inſtruction.</hi> For although we judg ſuch a courſe (however burdenſome to us) at preſent neceſſary, conſidering the long omiſſion of this exerciſe; yet we conceive a publick <hi>Catechizing</hi> farre more advantageou for the good of others, and would gladly lay in for poſterity, a better foundation to build upon, in the Reformation of the Church, then we our ſelves have met with.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:62331:18"/>
               <p n="7">7. And laſtly, <hi>As to the place, (for ſuch perſons, as will not be perſwaded to come into the open Congregation upon the Lords Day) to meet us, we are not overmuch ſollicitous.</hi> Whether it be in the Church, or ſome of our houſes, or at their own dwellings, we ſhall leave this to the prudence of each particular Miniſter, and gratifie the weakneſs of our People in that circumſtance, as they ſhall with any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable reaſon deſire at our hands.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Concerning the forme to be uſed in Catechizing, and why we have made choice of that in the leſſer Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme, adviſed by the late Reverend Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>VVE are not ignorant, how much ſome in the world (through weakneſs) are prejudiced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>formes</hi> in matters of Religion. The Apoſtle hints the poſſibility of mens being poſſeſſed <hi>with a forme of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and denying the power thereof.</hi> Yet doubtleſs a <hi>forme of Godlineſs</hi> in any is more commendable, then a courſe of prophaneneſs. All know how much this part of the world in theſe late years hath been engaged againſt <hi>formes of Prayer.</hi> Though we hope judicious Chriſtians will diſtinguiſh betwixt the <hi>lawfullneſs of a forme,</hi> and the lawfullneſs of <hi>this or that forme:</hi> and again, betwixt the lawfullneſs of <hi>uſing a forme,</hi> and the lawfullneſs of <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Miniſters and People</hi> conſtantly to the uſe of one and the ſame forme. The Apoſtle (who ſpeaks ſlightly of a forme of godlineſs) yet ſpeaketh honourably of a <hi>forme of ſound Doctrine.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.13.</note> And however ſome ignorant people may be offended at the ſound of the word, yet we hope judicious Chriſtians will judg, That as there were not much to be ſaid againſt the conſtant uſage of the ſame formes of Prayer,<note place="margin">a Tim. 2.3.</note> if they <hi>were alwaies to pray for the ſame
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62331:18"/>things, without adding and detracting,</hi> (for ſurely God is not pleaſed with varying of phraſes expreſſive of the ſame thing.) So the ſame right reaſon will informe them, that the Doctrine of the Goſpell being ſealed, (ſo that neither <hi>an Apoſtle nor Angell from Heaven</hi> may adde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to it,) <hi>a forme of ſound words, may be kept</hi> to cxpreſs that, we have therefore declared our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To make uſe of a forme,</hi> the lawfullneſs of it being evident, the expediency of it conſtraines us to this. For beſides the diſproportion of Miniſters gifts and abilities, the capacity of our people doth require this at our hands, how ſhall they know what to anſwer? muſt we after e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very queſtion expect a ſatisfaction by <hi>Euthuſiaſme? Nor let any tell us, this is but to learne Children by rote, and to nurſe up a forme of Godlineſs; that the teaching of the Spirit is the Goſpell teaching,</hi> &amp;c. We would faine learne of theſe our weaker Brethren, what it is that Children learne at firſt otherwiſe then by rote? do they not learne to ſpeake by rote? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or why our Brethren ſuffer their Children to learne to write by Copies, (which are formes in that art) beſides that ſome Children may be found ſo apprehenſive, as to conceive the thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the forme of words. However this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lyeth as much againſt <hi>Timothies</hi> being inſtructed from his infancy, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. as againſt what we are driving at. And ſuppoſing that without the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the ſanctifying Spirit, the iſſue of this teaching, will be but a notionall knowledg in the head, and a forme of godlineſs in the life. May not as much be ſaid against Preaching as againſt this? nor do we intend, either to anticipate, or juſtle out the teaching of the Spirit; we hope judicious Chriſtians know how to diſtingiuſh betwixt <hi>miniſteriall</hi> and <hi>effectuall teaching.</hi> Our deſigne is no higher by this exerciſe, then to <hi>prepare the way of the Lord</hi> in the ſouls of his People. But theſe Objections are too vaine to be inſiſted upon: Having agreed the lawfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and expediency, if not the neceſſity of uſing a forme,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62331:19"/>we come in the next place to agree the particular forme. Where</p>
               <p n="2">2. We declare our reſolution, <hi>to make uſe of that forme which is found in the leſſer Catecbiſme, adviſed by the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Aſſembly.</hi> We are aware, that this Agreement of ours may be liable to the exeptions of ſome and more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially three forts of perſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such who can allow nothing good, but what was eſtabliſhed by (what they call) the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Theſe will poſſibly quarrell at our laying aſide the forme preſcribed in the Book of Common Prayer. We are very far from condemning thoſe <hi>Reverend Perſons,</hi> that had an hand in compoſing either of the <hi>Lyturgy</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or that <hi>forme of Catechizing</hi> in particular: but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe they walked up to their light, and did wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily in their generation. But ſurely, God expects high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er improvements from us, and we thinke any (reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble learned) Divines upon peruſall of that forme will find ſome Queſtions inſerted, not ſo proper for a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, and ſeverall <hi>Fundamentull Priaciples</hi> of Religion, very obſcurely hinted, if at all touched: Which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the injunction of the Civil Power upon us to diſuſe that Book, is ſufficient warrant for us without condemning our <hi>Reverend Fathers,</hi> to lay aſide thoughts of uſing that.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond fort are ſuch, who for want of this form, when they entred upon their charges, <hi>have for a long time inured their people to another forme, either compoſed by themſelves, or ſome other Reverend Men:</hi> Or elſe who out of a deſire to conceale ſome opinions of their own in matters of Doctrine, chuſe rather to make Catechiſmes of their own, then by the uſe of this to diſcover their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions to the world by entring a diſſent unto the things contained here. For theſe latter we have nothing to ſay it being very uſuall for men to uſher in <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to avoid which (as we ſhall more fully expreſs by and by) we have pitched upon this forme. For the former, As we deſire to reverence thoſe of our
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62331:19"/>Brethren, who indeaved to ſupply the defect of former times, by uſing their people to Catechiſmes, more full then that which then had the ſignature of publickautho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and judge it but juſt they ſhould reape the fruit of their own labours. So we hope, that ere this time they may have brought up their people to ſuch a proficiency, in that forme, that they may paſs on to this, and keep Uniformity with us, which we perſwade our ſelves they will find more eaſie; becauſe in matter they will find no difference. We have nothing to ſay to ſuch as out of deſigne, or ſingularity, ſet up another method, judging that thoſe luſts ought to be mortified and not humoured, and indulged. And for the opinion of ſome, that this forme is too large; Experience hath taught ſome of us the vanity of it, it being no more then Children of ſeaven yeares of age, have with much facility, in a ſhort time got through.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But there is a third ſort, who have nothing to ſay againſt it, but that it was <hi>agreed by that Reverend Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,</hi> and they are over jealous for us, as if we would <hi>jurare in verba Magiſtri.</hi> To convince therefore our Brethren, that we have more to ſay for the adhering to this then any other forme extant, we ſhall ſhortly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie our Brethren with our Reaſons, why we have pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it.</p>
               <p>There are five things which we judg reaſonable for us to attend, in making choice of a forme of Catechiſm. 1. <hi>Fulneſs of matter.</hi> 2. <hi>Purity of Doctrine.</hi> 3. <hi>Brevity of Anſwers.</hi> 4. <hi>Plainnoſs of phraſe.</hi> 5. <hi>Orderlineſs.</hi> To which we may adde two others, which yet may be comprehended under the latter. 1. <hi>Uniformity,</hi> and 2. <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we hope every reaſonable Chriſtian will judge with us, that in the choice of a forme to be uſed in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing, if we can find any forme, that hath in it a full Syſteme of the Doctrine of the Goſpell, and that in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive purity, expreſſed plainly, and comprized in anſwers ſuited (for their brevity) to the capacity of the meaneſt,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62331:20"/>and this forme hath alſo the countenance of Publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and be generally approved and uſed by other Churches of the ſame perſwaſion with us in the things of God: this in all reaſon ought to be pitched upon by us, and preferred before any other forme, and may give a juſt ſuperſedeas, to any needleſs indeavours of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, in compiling any other Catechiſmes for their particular Congregations, eſpecially conſidering how ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious ſuch actions may be, and of what ill conſequence in opening the like doore of liberty to others, who poſſibly may have leſs ability, or further deſignes, and may too much affect a fooliſh ſingularity. Every underſtanding Chriſtian will diſcerne, the reaſonableneſs of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and adjuncts in reference to the choice of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular forme.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Fullneſs of matter.</hi> The deſigne of Catechiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being the inſtruction of people in all the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Points of the Goſpell, in reaſon we ſhould chuſe ſuch a forme as is a full Syſteme of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Purity of Doctrine.</hi> Where the Doctrine of the Goſpell is not daſht with erronens Principles, but the milke is (as the Apoſtle calls it) <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſincere with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixture. That forme of Catechiſm is doubtleſs beſt, which is not, <hi>as many corrupting the word of God, but as of ſincerity, as of God, as in the ſight of God ſpeaking in Chriſt,</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of himſelf and his Preaching, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17.) One great end of Catechizing is the preſervation of the purity of Doctrine. The Devill himſelf grants his vote approbatory of Catechizing by a forme, as the probableſt courſe to propagate errors, and Doctrines of Devils, (witneſs the <hi>Racovean Catechiſm</hi>) and thoſe of the Romiſh Doctors, — <hi>Habet &amp; vespae ſuos ſavos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Brevity of Anſwers.</hi> For it is a way of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, fitted to every capacity, and the weakeſt memories, are to be conſidered in the exerciſe of it.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:62331:20"/>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Plainneſs or perspicuity.</hi> Catechiſticall Doctrine is called the Foundation by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. Men uſe not to beſtow carving worke upon foundation ſtones. Truth needs no flouriſhes to adorne her, ſhe looks beſt in her native habit.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And laſtly, <hi>Orderlineſs,</hi> is a thing not to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. By which we chiefly underſtand here, an orderly Connexion of the Fundamentall Principles of Religion. This doth not only make the whole more beautifull, but tends much both to the helping of the memory, and the underſtanding alſo.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being chiefly deſirable in the choice of a forme, and all of them (if we miſtake not) evident to every judicious Chriſtian in this particular forme, which we have pitched upon, we have from other two conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations been over-ruled to this choice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>From the conſideration of the generall approbation which this forme hath received in the Churches of Chriſt.</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to the Doctrine of which the Churches of God in <hi>New England</hi> have ſubſcribed, and the whole forme agreed upon, by Brethren of different perſwaſions, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our ſelves) in matters of <hi>Church-Governement.</hi> It being alſo receive by the Church of God in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and agreed to be uſed as part of the intended, and deſired <hi>Uniformity</hi> betwixt the two Nations, and that in which our Brethren of the <hi>Province of London,</hi> and in other <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociations in ſever all Counties</hi> have agreed; And we are aware of how much conſequence it is, eſpecially as to matters of Doctrine, in the things of Religion, that Chriſtians ſhould learne to ſpeak <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  </gap> the ſame thing: That paſſage of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. doth in this thing lay a Law upon us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now I beſeech you Brethren, by the name of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that you all ſpeake the ſame thing, and that there be no diviſions amongst you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor laſtly, Do we think the <hi>authority inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with which that forme is more clothed then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> If we ſhould not allow that <hi>Reverend Aſſembly,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:62331:21"/>which compoſed that forme to have had all the form ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of an Eccleſiaſticall Synod, and conſequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the obligation of their Acts, yet it muſt be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, 1. That they were <hi>convened</hi> and directed to this work, by Authority of <hi>Parliament.</hi> 2. That <hi>this was a worke proper to them.</hi> 3. <hi>That there were many of them,</hi> and thoſe <hi>holy and Learned Men,</hi> Paſtors of ſeverall Churches, mighty in the Scriptures, furniſhed <hi>with</hi> all internall qualifications, for the work to which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God called them. 4. That in the compoſing of it, it was ſet up like a Butt, againſt which any of that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly (in which were alſo perſons of differing perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) might ſhoot their Arrowes: and every parcell of it deliberately peruſed. That being thus compoſed, it was openly read in the Parliament, by that Parliament Ordered to be Publiſhed, and all due care taken, that it might be ſaithfully communicated to the Nation from the Preſs.</p>
               <p>We muſt profeſs, when we conſider the matter, the forme, the Compoſers, the care taken in the Compoſure, and Publication, the intendment of the Aſſembly in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, and of the Parliament in the Publication, we cannot but admire, the deſigns of any, who ſince the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of that, hath needleſly laboured to Publiſh any other Catechiſme of his own, at leaſt with any deſigne to uſe it in the publick Congregations, and for our own parrs, if we could allow our ſelves ſuch an humour, we ſhould feare it would ſignifie to the world that we had ſome deſigns under ſome covert expreſſions, to innovate in matter of Doctrine, or that we too much ſancied our own methods, and ſingularities, or at leaſt that we were not ſo well wiſhers to Uniformity, in matters of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in the things of God, as we deſire we may be found in our generations. And thus much we hope may ſatisfie our Brethren for our reſolutions concerning the choice of this particular forme.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Giving an account of the two laſt Articles of our Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning Catechizing.</head>
               <p>THe two laſt Branches reſpect our Agreement in judgment concerning the perſons upon whom this duty is incumbent, and our Agreement as to point of practice, in order to the enforcing of it where there ſhall appear to us a wilfull neglect of it.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, We humbly conceive it a duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, upon all thoſe who have the charge of others, though in a different degree and manner.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Upon <hi>Magiſtrates, Qua Magiſtrates,</hi> to command the performance of it; and to take care that thoſe under their charge diſcharge their duty in it; we find an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mention in Scripture, of thoſe godly Princes, that commanded the performance of thoſe things, from their Prieſts, and Levites, and people, which God had given them in charge to do.<note place="margin">2 King. 22.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Joſiah</hi> commanded <hi>Hilkiah</hi> and <hi>Ahikam,</hi> and <hi>Achbor,</hi> and <hi>Shaphan,</hi> and <hi>Aſahiah</hi> to go and enquire of the Lord for him: and again he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>people to keep the Paſſeover. Aſa</hi> commanded his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to <hi>ſeek the Lord, and to do the Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chro. 14.4. 2 Chron. 29.21, 24, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Hezekiah</hi> commands the Prieſt to offer Sacrifice and the <hi>Levites</hi> to ſing. <hi>Manaſſeth</hi> when he was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God <hi>commanded the people to ſeek the Lord God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> And we cannot think that the <hi>Schooles of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> (of which we read ſo often in the Old Teſtament) were erected otherwiſe then by <hi>publick Authority.</hi> We are ſure if the Magiſtrate be entruſted with the cuſtody of both Tables, this will follow. We will eaſily grant that the Magiſtrate hath nothing to do, to command that in the worſhip of God which God hath not firſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But that it is not his concernment (by the interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his civill authority) to inforce the obſervation of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62331:22"/>what God hath commanded, is a piece of new Divinity to us, and we conceive calculated only for the <hi>Meridian</hi> of ſome <hi>Atheiſticall Principles.</hi> We are ſure thoſe who neglect theſe duties are <hi>evill doers,</hi> and to ſuch the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ought to be a <hi>terror.</hi> We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore with the ſuffrage of that never enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acta Syn. Dord. ſeſs <hi>17<hi rend="sup">a</hi>.</hi>
                  </note> —<hi>Ut omnes diligenter officium fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciant rogandierunt Magiſtratus Chriſtiani, ut tam ſanctum &amp; neceſſarium opus authoritate ſuâ promoveant.</hi> And we bleſs God that we are not out of hopes of ſeeing our deſires in this thing. We ſhall beg of God, that as he hath in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Councell of the Land, given ſtrength to conceive and to bring to the birth, ſomething of this nature, ſo that in his own time he would give alſo ſttength to bring it forth: But we ſhall proceed to ſuch, whom the work more immediately concerns: Thoſe are ſuchas have the charge of others under their more immediate inſpection. 1. <hi>All Miniſters of the Goſpell, and Elders of Churches.</hi> 2. <hi>Such as are entruſted with the education of youth in Schooles.</hi> 3. <hi>Such as have an Oeconomicall charge, either as Parents or Maſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For ſuch as are <hi>Elders of Churches,</hi> we conceive the caſe is plaine enough, not to diſpute whether Paſtor and Teacher be two diſtinct offices, or exhorting, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two diſtinct acts of the ſame office. We conceive it the duty of all ſuch as have a paſtorall charge, under a larger or ſtricter notion, this being common to both to <hi>feed the people</hi> with wiſdome and underſtanding, we know none will diſpute this with us. As for ſuch Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es where are Ruling Elders, we cannot wholly exempt them from this concernment. <hi>The ſecluding of the ignorant from the Lords Supper,</hi> being an act of <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> in which all that rule in the Church, in reaſon muſt be concerned, and we cannot judg it reaſonable, that they ſhould be blindfolded in judgment. Beſides that we find this the expreſs ſenſe of the <hi>Synod of Dort,</hi> in the place before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and the Decree of the Magiſtrates of <hi>Geneva,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned) includeth them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For ſuch as are intruſted with the <hi>education of youth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62331:22"/>in Schooles,</hi>

                  </note> We conceive we have no obſcura hints in Scripture, The <hi>Jewiſh Schooles</hi> being principally for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing youth in their Law, and we conceive we have made an ill exchange under the Goſpell; if the deſign of our Schooles ſhould be meerly to acquaint youth with the ſtile, and matter of Heatheniſh Authors, while in the mean time there is no regard of the knowledg of God. Nor can we conceive it ought to be neglected in <hi>petty Schooles,</hi> for wherefore do Children learne to read the Scriptures, but in order to the comprehending of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contained in them? for which we conceive Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing the moſt proper and accommodate meanes: This hath made us reſolve to preſs this duty upon all <hi>Schoole-maſters,</hi> and <hi>Schoole-dames</hi> in our Pariſhes, and we hope we ſhall in it approve our ſelves to the conſciences of all ſuch, as deſire to know and feare the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third ſort are ſuch as are <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Maſters,</hi> their duty lies in reference to their Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. We have ſpoken ſo much before to prove this their duty from the example of <hi>Abraham, David, Timothies mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and grandmother,</hi> the command of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. that we need not repeate any thing, how Parents (without inſtructing their Children in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion, ſhould according to the Apoſtles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand bring them up in the <hi>nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> we cannot tell. Nor what account Maſters ſhall in the great day of the Lord, be able to give concerning their Servants for whoſe ſouls they ſhall certainly have ſome account to make. It is an honourable record, the holy Ghoſt hath left of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Acts 10.2. that he was a <hi>devout man, and one that feared God with all his houſe, which gave much almes to the people, and prayed alway.</hi> We judg it a good old Principle, that the Maſter of a Family, is there a <hi>Prophet, Prieſt,</hi> and a <hi>King?</hi> A Prophet to inſtruct his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, by Reading and Catechizing, a Prieſt to pray for them, and a Prince to rule them, and to ſee to the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the will of God, by thoſe within his doors, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling ſuch as will not: in this they have <hi>David</hi>'s
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62331:23"/>preſident, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 101.2, 3, 4, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>As to the laſt thing mentioned in our Agreement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may poſſibly give ſome cauſe of ſtumbling, we ſhall adde a few words to convince our Brethren of the reaſonableneſs of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Magiſtrate</hi> not pleaſing yet to interpoſe his Civill Authority, enjoyning Parents and Shoole-maſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to do their duty. We have been at the greateſt loſs to conſider, how thoſe who are engaged to this duty, and whom no private or more publick admonition will quicken to the performance of their duty; may be enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the performance, or deterred from the neglect of their ſeverall duties in this thing: Corporall and pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary mulcts, being neither lawfull for us to impoſe, nor yet proper to the ſohere wherein God hath ſet us. We find the Divines of <hi>Haſſia,</hi> and <hi>Helvetia,</hi> and <hi>Breme,</hi> together with Reverend <hi>Diodate,</hi> and <hi>Tronchinus,</hi> thus giving in their ſenſe in their Papers preſented to the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> concerning this Subject.<note place="margin">Acta Syn.

               <p>Our Queſtion being only concerning the power, which may be exerciſed by the Officers of the Church untill the Magiſtrate pleaſeth to exerciſe his power. We have only to conſider what the other Divines thought in this caſe; Their advice is reducible to theſe heads:
<list>
                     <item>1. That Miniſters ſhould deny Marriage to ſuch as ſhould not firſt give them account of their faith.</item>
                     <item>2. That they ſhould deny, to admit any as Sureties in Baptiſm, who ſhould not firſt do the like.</item>
                     <item>3. That they ſhould before the Baptizing of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of any offered to Baptiſm, take a Catechiſticall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Parents, (in caſe he refuſeth they do not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the withholding Baptiſm.)</item>
                     <item>4. That they admit none to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, but ſuch as ſhall firſt openly give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their proficiency in the knowledg of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe, <hi>Marriage</hi> being an Ordinance of God, which concerns men, as men, not as Chriſtians, and Members of a Church meerly, and the <hi>Act</hi> being a <hi>Civil Act,</hi> and being not within the Miniſteriall commiſſion, which the Goſpell Miniſters have from Chriſt, (though an Act to which we conceive they may be commiſſioned from the Civil Magiſtrate, and moſt proper for them to performe by the Application of the generall Acts of their Office exhoting and prayer: they being perſons moſt fit for thoſe works, and Marriage the moſt weighty action of our lives, and fit to be attended with exhortation and prayer and ſo ſanctified.) We cannot ſee clearly what power Miniſters as Miniſters, have upon the ſolemnization
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62331:24"/>of Marriage, to engage parties to be Married to a ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to this duty, though we judg it neceſſary that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who are concerned to marry in the Lord, and to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry themſelves in their relations, <hi>as becometh the Gospell of Chriſt,</hi> ſhould be inſtructed in the Chriſtian faith, and know the relative duties which the Goſpel requireth of them.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond, If we could ſuppoſe <hi>Sureties in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> in all caſes neceſſary, or expedient, we ſhould judg it reaſonable and neceſſary, that he who admits them under that notion, for the education of a Child, in the true Religion, ſhould be firſt aſſured that they ſhould be fit for ſuch an undertaking. But we cannot lay much ſtreſs there, becauſe it neither appears to us from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-precept, or preſident, that ſuch Sureties ought to be admited; nor yet have we any record of any <hi>Compatres,</hi> for many hundreds of years after Chriſt; <hi>Propatres</hi> indeed were allowed, in caſe the Parents were unknown, dead, ſick, or abſent upon neceſſary occaſions: and there is none ignorant how groſly that uſuage of the latter Church hath been and is ſtill abuſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and how abſurdly it hath been uſed in our own Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Concerning <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> we do cleary agree, that it is a piece of prudence fit to be exerciſed, when perſons come to us to deſire Baptiſm for their Children, to try if we can get an account of their proficiency in the knowledg of Religion, and we ſhall our ſelves (as we ſee occaſion) practiſe it. But in caſe any Parents be ſo ſtubborn, that they refuſe to give us an account whether this may be judged by us a ſufficient warrant to deny, or withhold the adminiſtration of the Ordinance to the Child, is not ſo cleare to us. Our Reverend Brethren in the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> ſay no more, then <hi>opertunum tempus erit,</hi> &amp;c. it would be a fit time to deale with ſuch Parents. It is true, that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm belongs to the Child in the right of the Parent, and that the unbelieving Parent hath no ſuch right, but it is as certain that the Child may have a claime in the right of either Parent, and that not the immediate Parent only.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:62331:24"/>
               <p>As to the fourth, We are the more confident, that it is our duty <hi>to withhold the other Sacrament from ſuch refuſers,</hi> not only becauſe we find this the Unanimous ſenſe of the Churches of God, met in the <hi>Synod of Dort,</hi> and alſo of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Divines in their particular writings, but becauſe the Apoſtle plainly tells us, that <hi>he who diſcerneth not the Lords body, eateth and drinketh unworthily, and ſo becomes guilty of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and eateth judgment to himſelf.</hi> And we being <hi>Stewards of the Myſteries of God (of whom it is required that they ſhould be faithfull,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.1, 2.) cannot conceive we ſhould be faithfull in diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of that Sacred Myſtery, to thoſe concerning whom we have no evidence, that they are able to <hi>examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or to diſcerne the Lords Body.</hi> We muſt therefore look upon ſuch, 1. As <hi>Ignorant,</hi> and upon that account unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. 2. As <hi>Scandalous,</hi> obſtinately refuſing inſtruction, and upon that account alſo unworthy of that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>And it being (as before) concluded from <hi>Scripture,</hi> from <hi>reaſon,</hi> and from the <hi>Judgment of all the Divines in that famous</hi> (aforementioned) <hi>Synod,</hi> and by diverſe others in their particular writings, to be the duty of Parents and Maſters of Families, and ſuch as have the education of youth in Schooles, to be a piece of their duty alſo; in not doing of it, they ſhall fail in their duty, both to God, and to the ſouls of thoſe committed to their charge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will deſerve the more private <hi>admonition</hi> of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, and more <hi>publick admonition</hi> of the Church, if that will not do; and being under ſuch admonition, we ſhall conceive it our duty to withhold the Adminiſtration of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> to them, as perſons that are ſcandalous, untill ſuch time as we have evidence of their ſubmiſſion and reformation: Only we thinke the caſe of theſe may admit of exception in the caſe of ſuch Parents and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours as cannot read, and ſome other ſpeciall caſes. We have therefore added, <hi>[In caſe they refuſe to inſtruct them themſelves, or elſe to ſend them to us to be inſtructed:]</hi> We hope we ſpeak to perſons, that know ſo well the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62331:25"/>which God hath give them over their Children, or Servants, that none of them will ſay to us, <hi>what if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make them come?</hi> ſurely the <hi>rod of Correction</hi> is not only made, but alſo put into the hands of Parents and Maſter too <hi>for the backs of ſuch fooles:</hi> And as none is fit to be truſted, with the government of the bodies of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or Servants, who if they ſhould be ſo lazy that they would not worke, could not tell how to bring them to a better mind: So we judg them every way as unfit to be truſted with their ſouls, who know not how to uſe their Authority to them, to make them ſubmit to the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their ſouls in the things of God.</p>

            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. The excellenty of the knowledge of the things of God.</hi> All knowledge hath its proportionate goodneſs, but this a more eminent excellency, both in regard of the <hi>excellency of the Object,</hi> and alſo the <hi>uſefullneſs of the Act.</hi> It is the homage which the underſtanding gives to God, and without it, though the Affections may be laden with the fruit of good deſires and zeale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding will be barren and unfruitfull. That God who hath made the <hi>Affections,</hi> hath (doubtleſs) made the <hi>Underſtanding alſo,</hi> and expects an homage from the latter, as well as the devotion of the former; be hath made them both for himſelf, and is uneavenly ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by any ſingle power of the ſoule.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62331:27"/>for him that pretends to any profeſsion, to a practice in any Mechanick, or intellectuall myſtery, not to know the principles of that Art or Myſtery, to which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth; and is it not much more diſhonourable, to him who ownes the Reverend name of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in the Principles of Chriſtianity?

Is that knowledge ſweet, the utmoſt iſſue of which is but ſatisfying an itch of curioſity, fitting us for converſe with Men, or the gaining of an eſtate or intereſt in the world? and is there no ſweetneſs in that knowledge, which prepares us for converſe with Saints and Angels, for a converſe with God in duty, and for the enjoyment of God himſelf to all eternity? The knowing Chriſtian who is zealous alſo, is far better than him, that is, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous without knowledge; if knowledge and zeale lye in the ſoul together, there will be heat; if zeale runs ſo fact that it ſtumbles (as it did in <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe, and in the Jew; too) knowledge will <hi>lift it up;</hi> if a temptation to errors or Apoſtacy prevaile againſt zeale, if knowledge be with it, thoſe two ſhall withſtand it, and the threefold cord of knowledg, zeal, and ſincerity, in any ſoul will not be eaſily broken.</p>

               <hi>2.</hi> Conſider (we beſeech you) <hi>the danger of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the things of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1.8.</note> Christ will come in fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire, <hi>to take vengeance,</hi> as well upon them that <hi>know not God,</hi> as upon them, who <hi>obey not the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt.</hi> The ignorant as well as the diſobedient, <hi>ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction, from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi> Beſides how can you <hi>believe on him, of whom you have not heard?</hi> or worſhip that God whom you do

A meer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of things neceſſary to be known, pollutes us, and makes way for our damnation. But</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Conſider (Brethren) that an <hi>affected ignorance is much more dangerous.

Give us leave therefore to beſeech you in the words oſ <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> that you would <hi>attend unto wiſdom, and bow your ears unto underſtanding. —Leſt you mourn at the laſt,</hi> when your ſoul and body <hi>ſhall be conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and ſay, How have we hated inſtruction? and our heart deſpiſed knowledg, and have not obeyed the voice of our Teachers, nor inclined our eares unto thoſe who would have inſtructed us?</hi> Leſt any of you

               <hi>3.

Nor indeed can we reaſonably expect leſs. The Principles of Religion are in the bottom of our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, but in thoſe exerciſes, the truths of God are but lightly inſiſted upon; now and then one of them paſſeth by the ſoul, and it receiveth a little thereof, but it is atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with many expreſsions, ſerving only to ſtirre up the Affections; for the croud of which, thoſe who are ſmall in ſtature as to knowledg, can hardly diſcerne what the Principle is, which is the Subject of our Diſcourſe, (it is loſt in the retinew) ſo that the fruit of Preaching is ſeen rather in warming the heart, than in the information of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62331:28"/>the judgement; There the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt are one by one, (and that curſorily too) brought to the ſoul; but in theſe exerciſes they make a ſtay at the door of your hearts, and knock once and again, beſides that you ſee them in their native dreſs, nor are they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed from you, untill you have viewed them in every part and got a full cogniſance of them.</p>

But yet in regard that all ſuch Chriſtians ſtand obliged to a growth in knowledge, as well as any other grace, and we are ſure thoſe who know most <hi>know but in part,</hi> and this (as we have formerly argued) is a moſt accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date meanes in order to ſuch a growth, we are not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that this is a ſufficient plea for any, unleſs both they, and their Paſtors find that they have attained, ſome more than ordinary perſection in knowledge, before their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion into that degree of Communion. We look upon Catechizing, as an exerciſe deſigned to an higher end, than the meer preparing of Communicants for the Table of the Lord; and though we preſume that none admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that Table, by any conſciencious Miniſter, ſhall need be examined like Children, as to their knowledge in the firſt Rudiments of Religion; yet we truſt, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe may in a ſhort time be ſo farre improved, that it will not appeare a puerile exerciſe; we intend (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) to begin with the <hi>ſhort Catechiſm,</hi> (compoſed by the Aſſembly) and to examine it throughout, Without the Scriptures annexed, then to examine the Scriptures alſo, that it may appeare to our people, that their faith is not to be bottomed in the words of Men, but in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God; and we would hope that in time, we might
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62331:31"/>bring ſome of our people beyond that ſhorter forme, to give us ſome account of the larger Catechiſm; we heartily wiſh all thoſe in Sacramentall Communion with us, were thus farre inſtructed: but we find by too frequent experience, that even their knowledge is very diſproportionate, to the meanes of grace which they enjoy; and that few of them have a diſtinct and orderly knowledge of the firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion, and are much at loſs, to prove by Scripture, what they profeſs to know, and believe. Nor would we willingly reſt here, but would gladly bring up ſome of our people, to give us account of our Sermons, and of ſuch Queſtions, as we ſhall out of the reade of the Catechiſmes, propound for the further explication of the Anſwers found there. Now if we can ever ripen this exerciſe to ſuch a perfection, every one will judge that here will be ſomething more done, than can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Children; And we conceive that if any ſuch who are in fulleſt Communion with us, ſhall think fit to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer us ſome Queſtions, in the face of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, beſides the advantage may redound to others, who may thereby be encouraged to their duty, there may no ſmall advantage accrew by it to their own ſouls, whilſt by this meanes, their knowledge will be perfected, and their judgements ſetled concerning the things of God, and they will be enabled to give a reaſon of their hope, to every one that ſhall aske it of them.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> There is a ſecond ſort, who have nothing to plead <hi>but the force of a temptation, from the ſcorne and reproaches of their Neighbours, or poſſibly thoſe that live in the ſame Family with them.</hi> Who ſo remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, was not free from an <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and that a <hi>Michal</hi> was found in the boſome of him, who was <hi>the man according to Gods own heart,</hi> cannot reaſonably expect, that the large <hi>family of God,</hi> (which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62331:31"/>is his Church) ſhould be without ſome profane Scoffers at thoſe who are better than themſelves. Nor is this a ſmall diſcouragement to thoſe, who are not ſo well exerciſed in the things of God, as to have taſted the comfortable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, which are the returnes and rewards of duty in this life. The Phariſees ſcandall, <hi>(John 7.49. Have any of the Rulers or of the Phariſees believed on him, but this people which knoweth not the Law, and are curſed?)</hi> thrown in the face of theſe young Diſciples, made the generality of them turn head, and go every man to his own houſe. They had not ſate down before and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, what it would cost them to become Chriſtians. We heare the whiſperings of vain perſons. What? <hi>will you go to be Catechized like Children? will ſuch as you go? do you ſee any but Children, and thoſe the Children of ordinary perſons too that come there?</hi> &amp;c. It being not in our power to prevent the throwing of thoſedarts, we ſhall only make it our buſineſs to arme you againſt them.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> In the firſt place. What is ſaid of honour, <hi>That it is more in him that gives, than in him that receiveth it,</hi> is (we are ſure) much more true <hi>of reproach and diſhonour.</hi> It is a poyſon only hurtfull to that ſoul which ſpitteth it, and sticketh not at all to the face upon which it alighteth. It is that which <hi>comes out of a man,</hi> ſuch as vain words and ſinfull actions, or luſts within a man which defiles him, not what is thrown upon him from the hands of another; It is, and ought to be a ſmall thing to a Chriſtian, to be judged of Men; be ſhould remember that its his <hi>lot</hi> to go through evill as well as <hi>good report.</hi>

               <note place="margin">James 2.58.</note>

               <hi>3.</hi> It was a ſmart reply which <hi>David</hi> made to <hi>Michal,</hi> mocking him out of a window, while he was dancing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Arke, <hi>2 Sam. 6.20. How glorious</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>was the King of Iſrael to day, who uncovered himſelf in the eyes of the Handmaids of his Servants, as one of the vain fellows ſhameleſly uncovereth himſelf?</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, <hi>Verſe 21.

My ſoul is infinitely more precious to me, than my name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Sons of <hi>Belial.</hi> Of all ſober Chriſtiaus, yea of all who are but morally virtuous, <hi>I ſhall be had in honour.</hi> Yea thoſe vain perſons of whom you ſpeak that they will reproach me, ſhall honour me in the day of their viſitation. Mourning for ſin, never deſtroyed beauty; kneeling at Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, never ſpoiled a ſilk ſtocking; nor did a ſubmiſsion to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing, ever hinder any ones preferment in Marriage.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> And laſtly, (Brethren,) <hi>If we cannot get over ſo ſmall a ſtumbling block, as a ſcorners tongue in our way to Heaven, how ſhall we endure a Priſon? how ſhall we (if called to it) reſiſt unto blood?</hi> The Apostle tells us, <hi>That all who will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſuffer perſecutions.</hi> Of all perſecutions that from the tongue is (doubtleſs) the leaſt. We have read of ſome who from this form of <hi>Catechumeni</hi> in <hi>Origen</hi>'s School pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Martyrs,</hi> but we never read of any that did ſo who stumbling at the threſhold, would not come into this School.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> There is yet a third Plea, which ſome put in to excuſe them from this piece of duty, and that is from their <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall infirmity.</hi> Which by a miſtake, they nickname <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty;</hi> this they ſay will not ſuffer them, to expreſs their conceptions, eſpecially in a publick Congregation. In this plea Women are chiefly concerned, who make higheſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to this virtue, and would ſeem to have monopoliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to their Sex. To which we anſwer,</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:62331:33"/>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That we conceive it is a plea inſiſted upon in this licentious age at a farre leſſer advantage, than formerly it might have been urged upon. Heretofore indeed ſuch a modeſty had poſſeſſed the female world, that a Virgin muſt not be ſeen in a Congregation with a face uncovered, <hi>(Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beccah would not meet Iſaac, before ſhe had put on her vaile)</hi> and the violation of this Law of modeſty, was ſuch a ſcandall,<note place="margin">Lacteas quid prae te fers ſine linteo mammil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las? Quid hoc eſt niſi dicere, poſce! poſce! trado. <hi>Pontan.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls her, that in his times was ſeen without her vaile in the Congregation, <hi>Caput nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatitium, pudor oſtentatitiae virginitatis.</hi> None but <hi>Jeze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> then would <hi>paint herſelf, and look out at a window;</hi> and the very Poets would deride them, as preſumed ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, who made their breaſts naked. We ſay had this plea been inſiſted upon in that baſhfull age, it might have ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſomething inreality. But when we conſider the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt liberty taken in theſe duties, by too many of that Sex, in diſcovering their nakedneſs in the ſight of the world, yea even in the publick Aſſemblies, for divine worſhip (without regard to the Angels) ſtretching out their want on necks, and mincing it as they go, converſing with wantons, in mixed dances, yea at publick Taverns and Innes, <hi>&amp;c</hi> We are apt to think, that the guard of modeſty, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeemed originally to have ſet upon them, is long ſince dimiſſed, and wonder to hear of it any more in the world.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. Doth not nature it ſelf teach you, to make mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty give place in caſes of neceſſity, though of no higher concernment than bodily welfare?</hi> And have we not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated a neceſsity of being inſtructed in the things of God? or are ſoul neceſsities leſs conſiderable than thoſe which incumber bodily life or health? may the barres of modeſty be honourably paſſed for the latter, and leſt for ſtumbling blocks to the former?</p>
            <p>Neither do we think <hi>true modeſty</hi> in the lest concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as an hinderance to this ſubmiſſion. Which of you who
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62331:33"/>make this your plea, ſhould any of us (though before never ſo many witneſſes) enquire of you concerning your health, the welfare of your Parents, or other relations, or your other worldly concernments, would be ſo overcome with modeſty, as not to give us an anſwer? and why ſhould your <hi>modeſty</hi> be pleaded only when we come to quaery you concerning the things of God, and the concernment of your immortal ſouls?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> To conclude this therefore, we can eaſily grant, that there may be a <hi>ſhamefac'dneſs</hi> in ſome, which may hinder their ſubmſſion to this uſefull exerciſe; But as the <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> will allow nothing of this nature the name of a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall virtue; ſo much leſs is this <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to be humoured, which is an exceſſive ſhame, reſtraining us from what of it ſelf is praiſe-worthy and honourable. If therefore any plead this in earneſt, we have nothing to do but to tell them, that it is a luſt not to be gratified, but mortified. And in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deed, whatſoever of this is reall in any, ariſeth meerly from a fear of diſgrace, which (as to this thing) will no longer abide in any, than until they be raiſed to a confidence of their ability to ſatisfie their duty in it, and be convinced of this as their duty, and the eternall concernment of their ſouls, that they may not periſh <hi>for want of knowledg.</hi> We have (we truſt) ſaid enough to preſs the firſt thing which we had to requeſt of you. The ſecond was</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. A mutual aſſiſtance from you, as you are governours of others, enabling us to diſcharge that duty, which we confeſs our ſelves to owe unto the Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants committed to your truſt.</hi> And this in two things</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. Your more private preparing them for our work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. The exerciſe of your authority, in requiring their appearance to us when we are waiting upon this ſervice,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the firſt of theſe we do deſire our Brethren to conſider</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That beſides the common Obligations which ariſe from the bonds of <hi>naturall affection and common charity, and engageth Parents and Maſters, to take care of their
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62331:34"/>Childrens and Servants ſouls, as well as of their outward being and wellfare; they alſo lye under the obligation of a poſitive divine Law to the performance of what</hi> we deſire of them. The Iſraelites were obliged to take all opportunities to whet the Law of God upon their Children, <hi>Deut. 6.6, 7.</hi> and to cauſe their Children to underſtand the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> Exod. <hi>12.</hi> Both Children and Maſters are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged (in the fourth Commandment) with the ſouls of their Children, and of their Servants; to ſay nothing of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Abraham, David,</hi> the Mother and Grandmother of <hi>Timothy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Elie</hi>'s neglect of his Family cauſed the ruine of himſelf and it. Whatever any of our Brethren may fancy, there never comes a Child or Servant into any of their families, but he comes with this warrant from the great Lord of Heaven and Earth. <hi>Keep the ſoul of this Child, this Servant: for if it be miſſing amongſt the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of my ſheep at the great day, through thy neglect in reproving, inſtructing, or timely correcting, or reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, thy ſoul ſhall go for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> We beſeech our Brethren to couſider, <hi>That the duty, which we preſs upon them, is within the compaſs of their power.</hi> You cannot teach your Children, or Servants the fear of God, but you may teach them the knowledg of God, you cannot convey grace into their hearts, but you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey inſtruction into their minds. You cannot bring them to Chriſt, but you may bring them to Church; Doubtleſs the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of no duties will be ſo ſeverely revenged upon peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as thoſe which even in our lapſed eſtate we have a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to performe, if we want not an heart to them, and refuſe the performance of them.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3. We dare aſſure every one of you, that in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this duty, you will be like the Husbandman</hi> (of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) <hi>who reapeth, firſt of his own fruit.</hi> Thoſe who know moſt of God will beſt performe their duty to you; we cannot but look upon the undutifullneſs
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62331:34"/>of your Children, and debauchery of your Servants, as very much cauſed, from the neglect of your duty, who ſhould have taught them better things; and in your puniſhment in their miſcarriages you may many of you read your iniquity in this neglect of them.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> We are ſure, <hi>That by this performance of your duty you would much facilitate our work.</hi> The neglect of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Parents, in the inſtruction and gorvernment of their families, hath almoſt made the work both of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Miniſters unpracticable as to the latitude of their duty. Whence is it that your Children or Servants, are either aſhamed or afraid, to give any account to us of their knowledg or proficiency under our Preaching to them, but becauſe it is a ſtrange thing to them, to which they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accuſtomed at home.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> We might further adde, <hi>That by the practice of this duty you would find no ſmall advantage ariſing to your own ſouls,</hi> and this not only in the ſatisfaction you would have, while you ſhould ſee their proficiency in the knowledg of God, and you ſhall in the death, or miſcariage of any of them, have the teſtimony of a good conſcience that you have not been defective in your duty to them: But alſo <hi>in the further confirmation of your own ſouls</hi> in the truths of God, ſtirring up your own minds <hi>by way of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi> It will be of the ſame uſe to you, that the Jewiſh <hi>Phylacteries</hi> were to them, by means of which the truths of God will be alwaies kept in the eye of your minds.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing which we have to beg of you is, <hi>The exerciſe of your authority in commanding and requiring your Children and Servants to appear unto us waiting upon this piece of our Miniſtry.</hi> And for this we muſt be the more importunate, untill the Civill Magiſtrate ſhall be pleaſed to interpoſe his authority, (it being the only means we have to bring our wholeſome deſigne for the good of their ſouls, to any comfortable iſsue.)</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:62331:35"/>
            <p>We would hope the perſwading of you to this, ſhould be the eaſieſt part of our work; In our firſt requeſt we pleaded with you to put off ſomething of your ſelves, that you might <hi>put on Chriſt,</hi> performe (we mean) your duty to him. Here we aske you but to <hi>put on your ſelves,</hi> cloathing your delves with, and exerciſing that due Authority, which God hath given you, over thoſe under your roof. Thoſe who will not put themſelves to the inconſiderable trouble, once a week or oftner, to propound a few Queſtions out of a Catechrſm to their Children or Servants, in order to ſo great an end, as we have proved this exerciſe conducible unto, will doubtleſs do very little to help them to Heaven. But thoſe who refuſe this latter part of their duty, will do much leſs. We will not ſuppoſe that any Maſter or Parents ſhall ſo little underſtand the Authority, with which God hath inveſted them, as to tell us, that they cannot make them come. The <hi>Centurions</hi> Servants (of whom we read in the Goſpel) were at better command. And unqueſtionably if the Lord had not thought he had cloathed you with a ſufficiency of power over your Children and Servants, he would never have charged it upon you, to take care that they ſhould keep his Sabbath holy.</p>
            <p>We ſhall adde no more, but commend you all to the Lord, and theſe things to your ſerious conſideration, imploring the bleſſing of his grace.</p>
